# Lesson 1: Linear Algebra Foundations

## Topics Covered (Gilbert Strang MIT 18.06)

### Current Implementation âœ“
- Vectors and vector operations
- Linear combinations, span, basis
- Linear independence
- Dot products and orthogonality
- Vector projection
- Matrices and linear transformations
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
- Determinants
- Matrix inverses

### Missing Strang Topics (To Add)
- **Column space, row space, nullspace**
- **Rank and dimension**
- **Four fundamental subspaces**
- **LU factorization**
- **QR factorization and Gram-Schmidt**
- **Least squares and projections onto subspaces**
- **Symmetric matrices and positive definiteness**
- **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**
- **Change of basis**
- **Markov matrices**
- **Differential equations (matrix exponentials)**

## Known Issues

### Matplotlib Freezing
If plots freeze or don't respond:
1. Run with visualizations off: type `n` when prompted
2. Or close plot windows immediately after they appear
3. TkAgg backend is set for better compatibility

### Performance
- Lesson runs in text-only mode: ~30 seconds
- With visualizations: ~2-3 minutes
- Reduced data points for faster rendering

## Running the Lesson

```bash
python lesson.py
```

Type `n` at the prompt to skip visualizations for fastest experience.
